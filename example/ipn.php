 *  PHP-PayPal-IPN Example

 *  This shows a basic example of how to use the IpnListener() PHP class to 
 *  implement a PayPal Instant Payment Notification (IPN) listener script.

/*
Since this script is executed on the back end between the PayPal server and this
script, you will want to log errors to a file or email. Do not try to use echo
or print--it will not work! 

Here I am turning on PHP error logging to a file called "ipn_errors.log". Make
sure your web server has permissions to write to that file. In a production 
environment it is better to have that log file outside of the web root.

$listener = new IpnListener();

require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../wp-load.php');

/*
When you are testing your IPN script you should be using a PayPal "Sandbox"
account: https://developer.paypal.com
When you are ready to go live change use_sandbox to false.
*/
$listener->use_sandbox = true;

/*
By default the IpnListener object is going  going to post the data back to PayPal
using cURL over a secure SSL connection. This is the recommended way to post
the data back, however, some people may have connections problems using this
method. 

To post over standard HTTP connection, use:
$listener->use_ssl = false;

To post using the fsockopen() function rather than cURL, use:
$listener->use_curl = false;
*/

/*
The processIpn() method will encode the POST variables sent by PayPal and then
POST them back to the PayPal server. An exception will be thrown if there is 
a fatal error (cannot connect, your server is not configured properly, etc.).
Use a try/catch block to catch these fatal errors and log to the ipn_errors.log
file we setup at the top of this file.

The processIpn() method will send the raw data on 'php://input' to PayPal. You
can optionally pass the data to processIpn() yourself:
$verified = $listener->processIpn($my_post_data);

was "INVALID".

    /*
    Once you have a verified IPN you need to do a few more checks on the POST
    fields--typically against data you stored in your database during when the
    end user made a purchase (such as in the "success" page on a web payments
    standard button). The fields PayPal recommends checking are:
    
        1. Check the $_POST['payment_status'] is "Completed"
	    2. Check that $_POST['txn_id'] has not been previously processed 
	    3. Check that $_POST['receiver_email'] is your Primary PayPal email 
	    4. Check that $_POST['payment_amount'] and $_POST['payment_currency'] 
	       are correct
    
    Since implementations on this varies, I will leave these checks out of this
    example and just send an email using the getTextReport() method to get all
    of the details about the IPN.
